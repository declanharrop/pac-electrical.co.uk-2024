An individual panel consists of cells made from layers of a semi-conducting material, which is commonly silicon. When sunlight shines on these cells, a flow of electricity is created. The electricity generated is DC (direct current) and the electricity used in households is AC (alternating current), so when we install your panels, we will also install an inverter.',

The brighter the light, the higher the output! Solar panels work best in direct sunlight so you won’t be producing as much electricity as you would on a sunny day, but you will generate enough to reduce your reliance on the National Grid.',
