        "a": "If you’re considering an electric vehicle, getting a home EV charger is the next obvious step. A domestic EV charger reduces the stress of finding a place to charge your vehicle, so you won’t have to spend as much time planning your journeys around charging points. By charging overnight, you can wake up to a full battery, making it a stress-free experience as there is no dependence on public charging points."

        "q": "Is it worth installing an EV charger at your business?",
        "a": "Installing an EV charger is a great investment for your business. Commercial EV chargers can increase the footfall of your business and help improve your image. They reduce the stress of finding a place to charge your electric vehicle, so you won’t have to spend as much time going out of your way before or after work to find somewhere to charge your vehicle. By charging at work, you can leave with a full battery, increasing employee and customer satisfaction."

        "q": "Is it cheaper to charge my electric vehicle at home or work?",
        "a": "Yes, using a home or workplace charger will cut your charging costs considerably as you won’t have to pay for charging at public locations. To take top advantage, choose a low tariff and charge overnight when there is little demand to keep your charging costs low."

        "q": "How much does it cost to charge my electric car?",
        "a": "Charging a car at home or your workplace is cheaper than using a public charging point. You can work out how much it’ll cost you by multiplying the battery size of your electric car by the tariff. That’s why it’s important to choose a low-cost energy tariff."

Prolonged use of 3-pin sockets can be dangerous for both your safety and your vehicles. Overheating of the socket may occur and this type of charging is recommended for emergency use only."
