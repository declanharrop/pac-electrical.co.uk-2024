        q: 'If it’s cloudy outside, will I still generate electricity using my solar panels?',
        a: 'Yes, don’t worry, solar panels don’t need direct sunlight to generate electricity. So even on those cloudy days, you’ll still be generating your own energy. The brighter the light, the higher the output! Solar panels work best in direct sunlight so you won’t be producing as much electricity as you would on a sunny day, but you will generate enough to reduce your reliance on the National Grid.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How do solar panels work?',
        a: 'Solar panels generate electricity from the sun’s rays, so whenever the sun is shining, you’re creating electricity! Solar electricity panels are known as photovoltaics (PV). An individual panel consists of cells made from layers of a semi-conducting material, which is commonly silicon. When sunlight shines on these cells, a flow of electricity is created. The electricity generated is DC (direct current) and the electricity used in households is AC (alternating current), so when we install your panels, we will also install an inverter.',
